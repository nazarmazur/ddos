<h1 align = "center"> How to deploy virtual machines to Digital Ocean </h1>

<br/>

** IMPORTANT ** ** Here are the steps you can use to deploy virtual machines to Digital Ocean. However, remember that DDoS attacks can be banned, so if you already have a Digital Ocean account, I advise you to create a new one for this purpose. All you need is mail and a virtual card (and you can make many of them in just a few minutes). Banned account - make a new and forward;)

<br/>

1. Follow [this link] (https://www.digitalocean.com/). Or you can use [this is] (https://www.digitalocean.com/try/free-trial-offer?utm_campaign=emea_brand_kw_en_cpc&utm_adgroup=digitalocean_credit_exact&_keyword=digitalocean%20promo%20code&_device=c&_adposition=&utm_content=conversion&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&gclid=CjwKCAjw_tWRBhAwEiwALxFPoVDd0Hf4gWRu_LpvHetaMH- ngZMQDnBquNqMCuo-CRWFkGztRCiFLBoCyykQAvD_BwE) to get $ 100 free for 60 days at a time (then skip items 6 and 7)

2. Sign up in any way (easiest with an existing Google Account)

3. You will then receive the following message. Choose `Add a Card`

</p>

4. Next, enter all the details of the card. You can enter a random name and address. Here it is best to create a virtual card in Privat Bank. There should be $ 5 on the card, which DigitalOcean will take to verify the card and return it later. Then you can withdraw these funds and leave the card simply with 0 balance (it is better to be reinsured than then DigitalOcean will "eat" some funds from your main card).

5. Everything is ready, you are registered and have added a virtual card. Next you will get the following window. Choose `Deploy a virtual machine`

</p>

6. Next on the left in the panel look for `Billing` and go there

</p>

7. Scroll down and in the field Promo code enter the promo code `SAMMY60DAY` (we will be given a free $ 100 for our needs for 60 days)

</p>

8. Go to the Droplets tab. Click Create Droplet. Then the first two parameters are left by default. We choose the third one according to your needs. I advise you to take `Premium Intel with NVMe SSD` for $ 24 a month. If you need a more powerful machine - take for $ 48 (but make sure that it does not work constantly, because just your whole $ 100 bonus will burn quickly). If you can do with less resources, then take cheaper

</p>

9. Next, choose a country. Choose to your liking, but if you create several Droplets on one account, then for each subsequent Droplet choose a different location (so you will have virtual machines in different countries, and accordingly IP addresses from different countries)

</p>

10. Next in Authentication select Password and come up with a password according to the rules

</p>

11. Then we leave everything by default and do not change anything. Click Create Droplet. And you have to wait a bit.

12. Congratulations! Virtual machine created! To go inside, just click on it

<p align = "center">
  <img src = "https://github.com/SlavaUkraineSince1991/DDoS-for-all/raw/main/images/DigitalOcean/droplet_entry.png?raw=true? raw = true" />
</p>

13. Next, to open the console and start working with it, click on the top right of the Console

<p align = "center">
  <img src = "https://github.com/SlavaUkraineSince1991/DDoS-for-all/raw/main/images/DigitalOcean/droplet_open.png?raw=true? raw = true" />
</p>

14. The console will open in a new window

<p align = "center">
  <img src = "https://github.com/SlavaUkraineSince1991/DDoS-for-all/raw/main/images/DigitalOcean/console.png?raw=true? raw = true" />
</p>

15. Congratulations! Everything is completely ready for work. You can make a lot of such virtual machines on one account and you can also open many virtual machines at the same time (of course, within reason, so that you have money left;)). To make new virtual machines just repeat steps 8-13

16. Then in the console of each of the virtual machines you can install the necessary software, run scripts with attacks and so on.

17. ** Warning! ** If you have stopped the attack and understand that you will not attack soon (go to bed, go on business, etc.), then delete all Droplets, then re-create and download the necessary software. This will save the $ 100 we received under the promo code. To do this, go to the Droplets tab, then to More and then Desrtoy

18. Then follow [this link] (https://github.com/SlavaUkraineSince1991/DDoS-for-all/blob/main/MHDDoS_proxy.md) to learn how to carry out attacks on these virtual machines

That's all. If you have any questions
